Hardware code explaination:- 
1. We are using the following hardware components:- 
        BMP280 (Pressure sensor),
	    DHT11 (Temperature, Humidity sensor),
	    PIR sensor,
		LDR (light sensitivity),
		ATmega328p (microcontroller),
		MQ135 (CO2 sensor),
		Soil moisture sensor,
2. Hardware code is done in arduino IDE
3. In arduino code first we set all the pins of components and set new serial port for GSM module.
4. In void setup() function we are setting the pins of the components and displaying welcome message on oled screen.
5. In void loop() first we display all the hardware values on oled screen.
6. Then all those values are sent to the API using GSM module in sendData() function.
7. In sendData() function we set the functions of the GSM using AT commands as follows:- 
    i) AT+SAPBR=1,1 //Set bearer profile
    ii) AT+SAPBR=2,1 //Set bearer profile
    iii) AT+HTTPINIT //Initialize HTTP
    iv) AT+HTTPPARA="CID",1 //Set HTTP parameters
    v) AT+HTTPPARA="URL","link = "http://htsingh.pythonanywhere.com/setData?data=" //Set HTTP parameters
    vi) AT+HTTPDATA=0,10000 //Set HTTP data
    vii) AT+HTTPACTION=1 //Send HTTP data
    viii) AT+HTTPTERM //Terminate HTTP
    ix) AT+SAPBR=0,1 //Close bearer profile
8. Display data sent confirmation message on oled screen.
